excerpt: "I am currently a research scientist at CSIRO's Data61. Before joining Data61, I was a Ph.D. student in computer science at Australian National University. My work lies in the fields of software engineering, deep learning, and human computer interaction. By understanding the semantics of user interfaces (UIs), my work aims to improve designers‚Äô, developers‚Äô, and end-users‚Äô efficiency when designing, developing and using the mobile applications. I am currently working on android code generation from UI design, UI design search and generation, and mobile application accessibility enhancement."

I am currently a research scientist at CSIRO's Data61. Before joining Data61, I was a Ph.D. student in computer science at Australian National University. My supervisors are [Zhenchang Xing](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/zhenchang-xing) and [Chunyang Chen](https://chunyang-chen.github.io/). 

My work lies in the fields of software engineering, deep learning, and human computer interaction. By understanding the semantics of user interfaces, my work aims to improve designers‚Äô, developers‚Äô, and end-users‚Äô efficiency when designing, developing and using the mobile applications. I am currently working on android code generation from User Interface (UI) design, UI design search and generation, and mobile application accessibility enhancement.
